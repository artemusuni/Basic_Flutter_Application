I think project I am creating a basic Flutter application which will have:
  1. 2 pages and a navigation bar at the bottom
  2. A button on the home page which can be pressed to change color from red to green and vice versa.
  3. Light/Dark theme which will also use shared preferences.
  4. NOT IMPLEMENTED YET!, A custom startup animation.
